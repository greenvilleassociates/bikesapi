/* Use this Template as follows:
Assign each Controller a name and ID at the top of the file in the class definition.

Step 0: Add a New Table to the Database, and Reverse Engineer the Changes without building them. (see reverseinstructions.txt)
Step 1: Copy the Template.cs to the name of the New Controller you want to build. For example (Users.cs)
Step 2: Run a Search and Replace for "Template" to "Users"
Step 3: Use Visual Studio to check errors in Pluralities (Userss, etc) and fix them manually as there are only 4 blocks.
Step 4: The Post API is an update. For each field updated in the Table there should be a line supporting the update. 10 attributes, 10 lines.
Step 5: Build the New Combined Project and make sure it builds cleanly.
Step 6: Go to the Git Menu in Visual Studio and Open the Git Changes View. Post the Changes to the Network Repo.
Step 7: Verify the changes posted to the API in Github.
